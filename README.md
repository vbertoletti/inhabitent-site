A multi-page website with a blog for a camping supply company, Inhabitent Camping Supply Co., using WordPress as a content management system.

- This is a custom theme, also enabiling the client to dynamically modify information about their company on the WordPress backend. For instance, we have created a custom widget plugin to easily change business hours. 

- There's a toggle search feature that once search icon on the navigation menu is clicked, the search input field will appear and re-direct you to the results page when space bar is pressed.

- Added a transition using JS and SCSS to change the navigation menu when user scrolls past the hero banner on the home and about page.
